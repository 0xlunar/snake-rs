# snake-rs

Snake built in rust

## Bugs

1. input is blocking (causes game to stop until input)
2. game loop is arbitrary and not consistent on a frame rate (Potentially fixed unsure)
3. sometimes snake doesn't detect collision of self
4. Double inputs
5. game crashes if rectangle board
6. direction gets updated well after input received
